## Accomplishements of the task  
I used the _ADC , GPIO , TIMER , UART and PUTTY program_ in order to run that code, I tried to make the code as modular as i can 
,clean and readable. I achieved this through comments for each line of the code and some general comments before each lines describing what i'm going to do next.  
I tested this code on my _TIVA C_ to make sure that there are no errors.  
I first worked on interrupt that will be generated from pressing the push button,wrote the code for that and made sure that there are no problems then i moved on to enabling ADC and making it timer triggered to measure temperature every 3 seconds and i wrote the code for that then at the end i wrote the code for showing led status on serial terminal.  
For this code i used some header and startup files including drivers for the _tm4c123gh6pm_ ,some **typedef** and startup for **interrupt handlers**.  
I have a strong knowledge in C,C++,java,microcontroller archetecture and good knowledge of RTOS.  
I worked on similar projects before :  
1- interfacing of 2 microcontrollers one is reading a varrying voltage then convert it to digital and send it to the other microcontroller to display it on seven segment displays (using _ATMEGA32_).  
2-I worked on _TIVA C_ project including displacement sensor interfacing and showing accurate distance on seven segment displays.  

and other projects. I used for these projects **eclipse,KEILand CSS** and sometimes used **proteus** for simulation before uploading code.
